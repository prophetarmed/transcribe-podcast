We have the two characters, two principal characters involved. On the one hand Donald J Trump, who apparently now is being proposed for a Nobel Prize for Peace, if you can imagine such a thing. Yes, the other guy, otherwise known as Little Rocket Man, came Jung-ung, the leader of North Korea, who only a few months ago were uttering the direst threats of mutual annihilation, one against the other. Trump was thundering against abuse against Little Rocket Man in Pyongyang and the Little Rocket Man turned was uttering similar threats against the United States, but one stage, the argument was whose button was the bigger, the nuclear button on the desk of Donald Trump, you should, the world was bigger than yours. In fact, he was threatening to physically annihilate North Korea, wipe it off the face of the map, charming a charming dialogue between these two protagonists of world peace. Yes, and now what a difference? What a colossal, magical, mysterious transformation, almost the biggest conversion since St. Paul fell off his horse on the road to Damascus, astonishing. Now of course it's all sweetness and light. Little Rocket Man has now done 100, what appears to be 180 degrees turn. He is turned on a charm offensive, directed to the United States and to South Korea, of course, his neighbour, beginning with the winter Olympics, you see them there lining up with the athletes waving little little flags and all smiles, all sweetness and light. What an earth is occurring, people might ask. You know, when this business first erupted because it is true, it's perfectly true, that does a, that's the first interesting point. North Korea is a tiny little state, it's a Pygmy state, it doesn't even register normally in the radar of world diplomacy of world politics. Yet now of course it strides forward, Little Rocket Man strides forward, as being a great world leader. It's, he's planning to actually have a discussion with this old a pal in Washington with Donald J. Trump. The first American president that's ever met anyone from North Korea, if you please. After 50 years incidentally, I don't know if you know this, North Korea and the United States are still in the state of war. They've been in the state of war since the Korean War in the early 1950s, where by the way, the United States didn't get all its own way. In fact, it ended as a draw. Vietnam was the first war in history that America actually lost. In North Korea, it was a kind of drawing, but they didn't get what they wanted. And since that time, ever since that time, for more than five decades, the United States and North Korea, have been and are still in a technically speaking in the state of war. You've got the parallel establish between the border between North and South Korea, which is a military zone, or de-militarized zone, the actual line itself of course. But on either side there's artillery, there's troops, American troops of course also are stationed in South Korea, souting a boost on a daily basis on megaphones to propaganda directed the one against the other. And yet all of a sudden everything has changed. Now just think back a month or a few months ago when this latest crisis erupted between Washington and Pyongyang. At that time there was a mania, a serious taking place in the press, the media, not for the first time, spreading the idea that the entire world was on the brink of a press office. The world was supposed to be on the brink of World War III. Oh yes, they actually put that line forward. And many people actually believed it. People tend to believe it. I don't know why, but people tend to believe what's published in the newspapers and the television and so on and so forth in the media pushing this line of the imminence of the Third World War. Yes, and even many people on the left swallowed this nonsense except for ourselves. The Marxist be pointed out that it was nonsense. We pointed out and I repeat that under present conditions there are no conditions at the present time for anything resembling a world war between the great powers. That's ruled out for the series of circumstances which I don't have time to expound upon. Suffice it to note that the USA and Britain was not even able to bomb Syria because of the opposition to the world. There's different reasons why it's ruled out, but that's just believe me that there is no basis for a world war which isn't to say of course that the pieces broke now because small wars are taking place all the time and they will take place. Like the invasion of Iraq that was a small war, terrible consequences. The war in Syria, that is just another small war with equally terrible monstrous consequences. Or take the civil war in the Congo which people don't even notice that it doesn't even warrant, it wasn't even at that time. It wasn't on the front pages of the newspapers. Nobody knew. And yet five million people had tested me. They don't know how many people were slaughtered in that terrible conflict. So these small wars involving imperialism because that's at the bottom of it are taking place and will take place constantly all the time. But a world war, oh no, that was never on the cards. And this number of this nonsense, this colossal barrage of propaganda about war, was just entirely empty propaganda, neither more, no less. Nevertheless of course it is true North Korea, the small country, yes, but it's got a big army, big powerful army. They have intercontinental ballistic missiles and they have nuclear weapons. I don't think there's any doubt about that. Part of the logic of Kim Jong-un's position, and by the way, he's presented as a madman, he's not mad actually. Any more than Donald Trump, Trump is mad, this is slightly unbalanced, one might say, from his tweets. But no mad, no. Or rather, to put it to Shakespeare did, if this be maddeness, yet this method, did it? Oh yes, there was method in the argument of the North Koreans all along. They knew what they were doing. And by the way, they seemed to have achieved what they wanted. They got away with what they were angling for. The first angle, of course, was to build up a powerful arsenal which they have done, not as powerful of course as the US that's like a popcorn against heavy artillery. But nevertheless, they have quite a powerful army and they possess nuclear weapons and increasingly the power to deliver these weapons, although that delivery was not yet complete, from all the experts that I've seen. Nevertheless, they did pose a serious military threat to the USA. There's no doubt about that, and particularly in the South Korea, this is Japan. There's no doubt about that also. They pose a far bigger threat instantly than Iran ever did. And Trump is making a lot of noise about Iran, really, with that in a moment. But no, they did pose a threat. But you see, they never intended to use that weapon, and convinced of that. If they had commenced a war of any sort, then of course, it would have been an absolute cataclysm. For a start, sold the South Korean capital would have been obliterated immediately, even without the use of missiles. Because the North Koreans have got a range of heavy artillery directed against that city, which would have obliterated a matter of 24 hours. So therefore, the consequences of an actual war on the Korean peninsula would be absolutely unimaginable. But for that reason, it was never seriously intended. This was a bar, I'm convinced, I was convinced at the time, and now it's confirmed. It was a bargaining ploy of North Korea, of Pyongyang, in order to extract financial, economic, concessions from the USA. You see, the North, it is known that the North Korean economy is in a very parlor state. We don't know how far the story is about actual starvation and hunger is true, but that there in a difficult economic position one can believe. Now, it's clear that China has paid a big role in this. The China accounts for 80% of the trade with the North Koreans, rather. Particularly coal, which is its main export to China. At last year under pressure from the USA, but also because of their own concerns. I think the Chinese themselves were getting a bit worried about the antics of the man in Pyongyang. They applied pressure. You may or may not have noticed that prior to this latest outbreak of peace, as it's called, that Kim Jong-un actually made a trip to Beijing. It wasn't, it was kept pretty quiet in the first instance, but it is clear that he had some very serious conversations with the Chinese leaders who probably said, now look, this has gone far enough and you'd better sort yourself out. For the first time ever, the Chinese actually began to apply sanctions. Now, that's very serious from the start, point of North Korea, because that was entirely throttleed their economy, which as I say, it was in quite a parlor state anyway. And therefore, Kim Jong-un decided to play his card with the Olympics, with the Charm Offensive, with this completely unexpected offer to do away with this nuclear weapons. How far are he prepared to do that in practice? Of course, there's another matter, but don't forget, only a couple of months ago, he was like, oh no, North Korea will never get rid of its nuclear weapons. It's unthinkable. It's a matter of principles. Well, principles, of course, in politics have their price as everything else in international politics. And basically, what he's offering is to do away with, or to pass in the at least do away with the nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula, but in exchange for something. You know, as Margaret Thatchie said, there's no such thing as a freelance, and there's no such thing as a deal on nuclear weapons, and therefore they will extract the price. It is on the cards that Trump will meet little rocket man, that the composition will be very interesting when I wish I was a fly on the world over here, that composition. But either way, of course, it suits Trump also, because he's also in domestic difficulties, as you know. And then he can boast and brag that he's true. He'd be the first American president ever to meet with the president of North Korea. Big deal by the big deal maker himself. And of course, from his angle, Kim Jong-un, who's quite a smart cook, he's not a madman at all, but quite a clever guy. He's played on Trump's vanity. Trump, as you know, is a very vain individual, very full of himself. And therefore, he'll get all the Q doors and all the propaganda, which he requires. They will have to do a deal. Yes, they will do a deal. I don't doubt that for a moment. But of course, this deal will come with a price tag attached, and you better believe it, it's going to be a very heavy price tag indeed. The North Koreans will require a large amount of aid. Billions, maybe trillions, who knows, they will strike a hard bargain. There was an American Senator appeared the other day on television, and he said, no, no, no, this is going to come with a big bill. If the American people think that the Marshall aid plan was expensive, will they better be prepared for a shock? So that's the name of the game. It really is part of a cynical and carefully thought out plan. On the part of North Korea to obtain money, obtain money, as they say in legal terms, obtaining money from menaces, no, and the menaces. That's called blackmail in legal terminology. Now, as appears to all this, before we hasten to award Donald J Trump with the Nobel Prize for Peace, you better follow the other plot that's taking place. In relation to Iran, I see that Mr. Netanyahu, by the way, is under accusation of corruption, undoubtedly well-berated. His political situation is in jeopardy. He's raising a big pantomime. There's no other word for you. Someone television yesterday. It was just like a TV game show, not like politics or diplomacy or anything serious. It was crazy. It looked like a circus act in which he accused Iran of telling lies and of having nuclear weapons. At a time when the international agency concerned, he said that Iran has not got such things at all. Therefore, Trump seems to be, he's not clear. You never know what this individual is going to do. But he seems to be planning to break off the deal with Iran. That will have serious consequences. In further destabilizing the Middle East, as if it wasn't destabilized sufficiently at the present time. Yes, all this was taking place. All this indicates the colossal instability of world capitalism under world relations at the present time. That is perfectly true. Capitalism means war. That's also perfectly true. Yes, but a world war, my friends, no, please. Please, listen to me friends on the left. Those of a nervous disposition, don't worry. Go to your bed, sleep soundly at night. The rain gonna be no more.
